[Web scraping](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/web-scraping-attack/) is the process of navigating websites to extract specific data and save it in a database, spreadsheet, or other formats. Traditional methods struggle with dynamic content, CAPTCHAs, and constantly changing site structures.

Over 2 million companies, including Google, Adobe, OpenAI, and Apple, rely on web scraping platforms for data collection. This technology has revolutionized how we gather and use web data.

## How AI is Transforming Web Scraping

Artificial intelligence (AI) has drastically changed the web scraping landscape, moving beyond traditional manual coding to smarter, automated solutions. Here's how AI is making a difference:

1. **Improved Accuracy and Adaptive Learning**: AI models can self-correct errors and adapt to changing site structures, ensuring reliable data extraction.
2. **Handling Dynamic Content**: AI-powered tools can interact with AJAX, JavaScript, and other dynamic elements, capturing hidden or post-load content.
3. **Scalability and Efficiency**: AI enables multiple parallel scraping tasks, speeding up data collection.
4. **Contextual Understanding**: AI with natural language processing (NLP) understands context, making it ideal for extracting reviews, comments, or nuanced text data.
5. **Bypassing Anti-Scraping Measures**: AI can solve CAPTCHAs and mimic human browsing behavior to avoid detection.
6. **Continuous Learning**: AI models improve over time, learning from feedback to deliver better results.
