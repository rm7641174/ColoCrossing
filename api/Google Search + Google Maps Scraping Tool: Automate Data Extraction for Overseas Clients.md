### Enhanced Google Search Scraper (Version 3.0)
The newly updated **Google Search Scraper 3.0** introduces powerful features:
- **Google Maps Extraction:** Directly scrape company information from Google Maps using keywords. This is especially valuable for identifying accurate buyers in specific regions, a common need for foreign trade professionals.
- **Automated Pagination:** Automatically scrape data from multiple pages without manual intervention, mimicking human behavior to reduce CAPTCHA occurrences. In rare cases where CAPTCHAs appear, you can manually input the required code to proceed.

## Additional Features in Version 3.0

### Improved Search Process
Unlike Version 2.0, where you had to manually input keywords and navigate between pages, Version 3.0 automates the entire process. It loads the actual web pages into the tool and seamlessly flips through pages while extracting data.

### Proxy-Free Search Mode
For users whose proxy tools are disabled, the **Proxy-Free Mode** offers a solution. Enable this option and select a stable connection to scrape data without needing to bypass firewalls. Although slightly slower, it ensures uninterrupted access to Google.
