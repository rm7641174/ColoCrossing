## Understanding eBayâ€™s Website Structure

eBay organizes its vast product data in a hierarchical layout, making it essential to understand its structure before scraping.

### Key Features of eBay Pages:
1. **Categories and Listings**: eBayâ€™s primary navigation system includes categories and subcategories, each containing product listings.
2. **Search and Filters**: Users can refine results by price, location, seller rating, etc.
3. **Product Pages**: These pages offer detailed product information, including title, price, seller details, and customer reviews.
4. **Pagination**: Search results span multiple pages, requiring you to handle pagination in your scraping logic.
5. **Dynamic Content**: eBay uses JavaScript to load certain elements dynamically, which requires tools like **headless browsers** or **API-based scraping**.

## Structure of an eBay Page

eBay has two primary types of pages crucial for scraping: **Product Pages** and **Search Results Pages**.

### 1. Product Pages
A typical eBay product page contains:
- Product title
- Description
- Images
- Ratings
- Price
- Availability
- Customer reviews
- Shipping details
- Seller information
- Delivery time

Hereâ€™s an example of a product page structure:

### 2. Search Results Pages
When users search for products, they land on the **search results page**, which displays multiple listings with titles, prices, ratings, and links.

Scraping search result pages allows you to extract data for multiple products at once.

## Setting Up the Scraping Environment

### Step 1: Register for Crawlbase
Sign up for a **Crawlbase account** and obtain your API token from the [account dashboard](https://crawlbase.com/dashboard/account/docs).

### Step 2: Install Node.js and Crawlbase Library
Ensure **Node.js** is installed on your system. Install the Crawlbase Node.js library using the command:

```bash
npm install crawlbase
```

### Step 3: Create a Scraping Script
Create a JavaScript file named `ebay-scraper.js` and open it in your preferred text editor.

### Step 4: Add Crawlbase API Integration
Below is a basic JavaScript script to fetch and parse data from an eBay product page:

```javascript
const CrawlbaseClient = require('crawlbase');

// Initialize the Crawlbase API client
const client = new CrawlbaseClient({ token: 'YOUR_CRAWLBASE_API_TOKEN' });

(async () => {
  const options = {
    url: 'https://www.ebay.com/itm/354586733872', // Replace with the product page URL
    scraper: 'ebay-product', // Specify the scraper type
  };

  try {
    const response = await client.get(options);
    console.log('Scraped Data:', response.body);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
})();
```

Run the script using the command:

```bash
node ebay-scraper.js
```

This script extracts structured JSON data from the specified eBay product page.

## Extracting Specific eBay Data

Crawlbase provides two pre-built eBay scrapers: **ebay-product** (for product pages) and **ebay-serp** (for search result pages).

### 1. eBay Product Scraper
The `ebay-product` scraper fetches structured data, such as the product title, price, seller details, and images. Hereâ€™s an example of JSON output:

```json
{
  "title": "Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max",
  "price": { "value": "$1,429.49", "currency": "USD" },
  "seller": {
    "name": "beyond_theworld",
    "feedbackScore": 98.9
  },
  "images": [
    "https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/12345.jpg",
    "https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/67890.jpg"
  ],
  "shipping": "Free shipping",
  "condition": "New"
}
```

### 2. eBay SERP Scraper
The `ebay-serp` scraper extracts data from search result pages, including:
- Product titles
- Prices
- Ratings
- URLs
- Images

Modify the scraper parameter in the code to `"ebay-serp"` to target search results pages.
