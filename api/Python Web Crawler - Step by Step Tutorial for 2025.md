## What Is a Python Web Crawler?

A **Python web crawler** is an automated program designed to browse websites or the Internet to scrape data. It navigates through pages, discovers links, and follows them to extract valuable data.

### Key Features:
- Search engines rely on crawlers to build and maintain their page indexes.
- Web scraping tools use crawlers to fetch data from multiple pages for analysis.

Python web crawlers often use third-party libraries for implementation. Some popular options include:

1. **urllib/urllib2/requests**: Basic libraries for sending HTTP requests and retrieving responses.
2. **BeautifulSoup**: A powerful tool for parsing HTML and XML to extract useful data.
3. **Scrapy**: An advanced framework offering features like data extraction, pipeline processing, and distributed crawling.
4. **Selenium**: A browser automation tool, ideal for crawling JavaScript-generated dynamic content.

## 4 Popular Web Crawler Use Cases

Web crawlers have numerous applications across industries. Here are the top use cases:

1. **Search Engines**: Tools like Googlebot and Bingbot crawl the web to build searchable indexes.
2. **SEO Analysis**: Collect metadata and analyze response times, broken links, and backlinks.
3. **Price Monitoring**: Track prices on e-commerce sites by crawling product pages.
4. **Common Crawl**: Maintains a vast repository of web data, with billions of pages archived.

## How to Scrape the Web with Pyppeteer and APIs

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to web scraping using Pyppeteer, a popular Python library.

### Step 1: Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python
- Required libraries (e.g., Pyppeteer)

### Step 2: Visit the Target Website
Use Pyppeteer to access the website and identify elements for extraction.

### Step 3: Execute the Code
Run the following script to crawl the webpage:

```python
movies = await page.JJ('li.cli-parent')
for row in movies:
    title = await row.J('.ipc-title-link-wrapper')
    year = await row.J('span.cli-title-metadata-item')
    rate = await row.J('.ipc-rating-star')
    
    title_text = await page.evaluate('item => item.textContent', title)
    year_text = await page.evaluate('item => item.textContent', year)
    rate_text = await page.evaluate('item => item.textContent', rate)
    print('title: ', title_text)
    print('year: ', year_text)
    print('rate: ', rate_text)
```

### Step 4: Save the Data
Use the `json` library to save the data in a local file:

```python
import json

data = [{"title": title_text, "year": year_text, "rate": rate_text}]
with open('movies.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
```

## Tips to Avoid Getting Blocked While Crawling

Getting blocked is one of the biggest challenges in web scraping. Many websites use anti-bot measures to prevent unauthorized access. Hereâ€™s how to avoid being blocked:

1. **Rotate User-Agent**: Mimic different browsers to avoid detection.
2. **Run Off-Peak**: Scrape during low-traffic hours.
3. **Respect `robots.txt`**: Adhere to a websiteâ€™s crawling policies.
4. **Avoid Honeypots**: Steer clear of bot traps to prevent being flagged.

For advanced scenarios, consider using tools like ScraperAPI for automated anti-detection measures.
