### Key Questions to Ask Before Starting Your Campaign:

Answering these questions helps align your advertising strategy with your business goals for better results.

## 2. Organize Campaign Structure for Better Bid Management

A well-structured ad campaign reduces confusion and improves bid management. Here are some tips:

- **Segment campaigns by product categories**: For example, separate campaigns for "Bluetooth Headphones" and "Electric Toothbrushes."
- **Use detailed campaign names**: Include goals, products, ad types, and targeting. Example: `ACOS30 | HEADPHONE | SP | AUTO`.
- **One ad group per campaign**: Simplify by limiting campaigns to one ad group.
- **Separate keyword groups**: Create unique ad groups for generic keywords, branded keywords, and competitor keywords.

> Pro Tip: Maintain consistency in your campaign structure to avoid confusion and prevent internal competition between ads.

## 3. Use a Mix of Automated and Manual Campaigns

Walmart offers **two types of Sponsored Product Ads**: **Automated** and **Manual Campaigns**.

### Automated Campaigns
Walmart‚Äôs algorithm automatically selects relevant keywords based on your product details and decides ad placement (e.g., search results grid, Sponsored Carousel, Buy Box, or product pages). These are ideal for **new brands** as they require minimal keyword research.

### Manual Campaigns
With manual campaigns, you choose specific keywords and match types, providing greater control over targeting. While narrower in reach, manual campaigns allow for more **strategic bidding**.

### Strategy: Combine Both
Start with an **80/20 budget split** favoring automated campaigns if your brand is new. Gradually balance this split as your campaigns mature:
- **Automated Campaigns**: 45% of budget, generating ~40% of sales.
- **Manual Campaigns**: 55% of budget, generating ~60% of sales.

### Steps to Optimize Across Channels:
1. **Segment customers**:
   - Use behavior, demographics, and purchasing patterns to target in-store vs. online shoppers.

### Steps:
1. **Collect and analyze data**: Track click-through and conversion rates.
2. **Understand pain points**: Tailor ads to each platform‚Äôs audience needs.
3. **Test and refine ads**: Regularly evaluate and adjust strategies.

Visibility and conversion rates vary based on ad placements. Conduct **A/B tests** to find the most effective combination of ad placements and platforms.

### Example:
You‚Äôre promoting a kitchen appliance. Create two ads with the same budget but different placement bids:
- **Ad A**: Focused on desktop search results.
- **Ad B**: Focused on mobile placements.

Run both ads for a few weeks to identify which placement drives higher conversions. Then refine and scale your campaigns accordingly.

- **Walmart**: Bid $1.00, pay $1.00.

Careful bidding is crucial to control ad spend effectively.

## 10. Use Variant Bidding for Personalized Ads

Walmart‚Äôs **Variant Bidding** lets you promote specific product variations, such as colors or sizes. This is particularly useful for targeting seasonal trends or high-demand variants.

### Example:
- **T-shirts**: Bid higher on lighter colors in summer and darker shades in winter.
- **Deodorants**: Test which scents drive the highest conversions.

### Benefits:
- Improve conversions with targeted ads.
- Gain insights into variant performance for future optimizations.

## 11. Bid on Branded Keywords to Protect Your Brand

Always bid on your brand‚Äôs keywords to maintain control over your online presence and prevent competitors from hijacking your traffic.

### Example:
- Search ‚ÄúClorox wipes‚Äù on Walmart. If Clorox isn‚Äôt bidding on its keywords, competitors could appear instead, stealing potential sales.

### Pro Tip:
Also target **long-tail keywords** for higher purchase intent with less competition, e.g., "black running shoes with rubber soles."
