## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping, also known as **data scraping** or **content scraping**, is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. This technique allows users to collect unstructured data, such as HTML, and convert it into structured formats like databases or spreadsheets.

### Key Components of Web Scraping:
- **Crawler**: A bot that navigates the Internet by following links to specific websites.
- **Scraper**: A tool designed to extract and save information in a usable format.

### Benefits of Web Scraping:
- Access data thatâ€™s otherwise inaccessible.
- Save time compared to manual data collection.
- Enable in-depth analysis and informed decision-making.

## Is Web Scraping Legal?

The legality of web scraping depends on several factors, including the nature of the data and how itâ€™s collected. Generally, **scraping publicly accessible data** is legal, provided it doesnâ€™t violate laws or a websiteâ€™s terms of service.

### Legal and Ethical Web Scraping Guidelines:
1. Collect only publicly available, non-proprietary data.
2. Avoid scraping data protected by authentication mechanisms or intellectual property laws.
3. Do not overload a websiteâ€™s servers with excessive scraping requests.
4. Cite the source if you publish scraped data.
5. Use scraped data ethically (e.g., for analysis rather than competing directly with the source).

## Approaches for Web Scraping

Web scraping methods vary in complexity, from no-code tools to advanced coding techniques. Hereâ€™s an overview:

### 1. No-Code Methods
- **Manual Copy and Paste**: Select and copy data manually from a webpage.
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Inspect webpage elements to extract data.
- **Browser Extensions**: Tools like Web Scraper or Data Miner automate data extraction.
- **RSS Feeds**: Collect structured data from RSS feeds.
- **No-Code Platforms**: Tools like Diffbot, Octoparse, and ParseHub offer drag-and-drop interfaces for data extraction.

### 2. Low-Code Methods
- **Beautiful Soup**: A Python library for HTML parsing and simple data extraction.
- **APIs**: Many websites provide APIs for structured data extraction.

### 3. High-Code Methods
- **Scrapy**: A Python framework for large-scale scraping projects.
- **JavaScript Tools**: Use Axios and Cheerio in Node.js for advanced data extraction.
- **Headless Browsers**: Tools like Selenium or Puppeteer scrape dynamic, JavaScript-heavy content.

## How to Scrape Data Using Python

Letâ€™s walk through an example using **Beautiful Soup** and the Python `requests` library to scrape definitions from [WhatIs.com](http://whatis.com).

### Step 1: Access the Website
Use the `requests` library to send an HTTP request and fetch the website's HTML source code.

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("http://whatis.com")
html = response.text
```

### Step 2: Extract URLs
Search for HTML links (`<a href="URL">`) in the source code to gather clickable links.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
links = [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]
```

### Step 3: Filter Specific URLs
Identify patterns in URLs (e.g., all definition links start with `/definition`) to refine the extracted data.

```python
definition_links = [link for link in links if link.startswith("/definition")]
```

### Step 4: Export Data
Save the scraped data into a CSV file using the pandas library.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(definition_links, columns=["Links"])
df.to_csv("output.csv", index=False)
```
