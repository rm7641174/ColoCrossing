## How Does a LinkedIn Scraper Work?

LinkedIn scrapers work in two main steps: retrieving public profile web pages and extracting relevant data. Here's the general process:

1. **Identify Targets**: Start with LinkedIn profile URLs or specific search queries.
2. **Send Requests**: The scraper sends HTTP requests to retrieve web pages.
3. **Retrieve Content**: The scraper fetches and downloads the HTML content.
4. **Parse HTML**: Tools like Beautiful Soup or lxml parse the content to locate data points.
5. **Extract Data**: The scraper identifies and collects relevant data.
6. **Clean Data**: The extracted data is cleaned and structured.
7. **Export Data**: The cleaned data is saved in formats like Excel, JSON, or CSV.

**Note**: Scraping LinkedIn may violate its terms of service. Always consider ethical and legal implications before proceeding.
