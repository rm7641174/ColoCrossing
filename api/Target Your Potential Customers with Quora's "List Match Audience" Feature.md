## What Is Quora's "List Match Audience" Feature?

Similar to platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, Quora allows advertisers to create custom audiences using a "List Match Audience." The main identifier for creating this audience is **email addresses**. You can upload a CSV file containing your target audience's email addresses to Quora Ads and reach them directly.

This feature is perfect for B2B marketing campaigns. For example, if your business targets digital marketing agencies, you can upload a pre-scraped list of relevant email addresses to create a tailored campaign.

## How to Create a List Match Audience on Quora

Follow these steps to set up a List Match Audience for your Quora Ads:

- If youâ€™re targeting digital marketing agencies, you can scrape their contact details using tools like ScraperAPI.

### Step 2: Create Your CSV File
- Organize your email addresses in a single column.
- Save the file in **CSV format**. 

Hereâ€™s an example of how your CSV file should look:
